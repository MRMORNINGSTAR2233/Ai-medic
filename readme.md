# Medical Chatbot

This repository contains the code for a medical chatbot that is restricted to answering questions only about medical and healthcare topics. The chatbot is built using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model and is fine-tuned with instruction-tuning and RLHF to provide accurate, factual, thoughtful, and nuanced answers.

## How to Use

To use the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create an OpenAI API key and set it as the value of the `openai.api_key` variable in the `app.py` file.
4. Run the Flask app by running the following command in your terminal:

```
python app.py
```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `localhost:5000`.
6. Enter your question in the text box and click on the "Send" button.
7. The chatbot will generate a response and display it on the screen.

## Code Explanation

The code for the medical chatbot is contained in the `app.py` file. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. We start by importing the necessary Python packages.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify

import openai
```

2. We create a Flask app instance.

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

3. We define a route for the home page of the chatbot.

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
```

4. We define a route for handling user messages.

```python
@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_message = request.form['user_message']
```

5. We check if the user's message contains any medical terms.

```python
if contains_medical_terms(user_message):
```

6. If the user's message contains medical terms, we use the OpenAI API to generate a response.

```python
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "
